# iOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article lists and describes the different settings you can control on iOS devices. As part of your mobile device management (MDM) solution, use these settings to allow or disable features, set password rules, allow or restrict specific apps, and more.

These settings are added to a device configuration profile in Intune, and then assigned or deployed to your iOS devices.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings use Apple's MDM settings. For more details on these settings, see [Apple's mobile device management settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mdm/welcome/web) (opens Apple's web site).

## Before you begin

[Create a device restrictions configuration profile](device-restrictions-configure.md#create-the-profile).

## General

- **Share usage data**: Choose **Block** to prevent the device from sending diagnostic and usage data to Apple. **Not configured** (default) allows this data to be sent.
  - **Diagnostics submission settings modification (supervised only)**: **Block** prevents the user from changing the diagnostic submission and app analytics settings in **Diagnostics and Usage** (device Settings). **Not configured** (default) allows the user to change these device settings.

    This feature applies to:  
    - iOS 9.3.2 and later

- **Screen capture**: Choose **Block** to prevent screenshots or screen captures on the device. In iOS 9.0 and later, it also blocks screen recordings. **Not configured** (default) lets the user capture the screen contents as an image or as a video.
  - **Remote screen observation by Classroom app (supervised only)**: Choose **Block** to prevent the Classroom app from remotely viewing the screen on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows the Apple Classroom app to view the screen.

    This feature applies to:  
    - iOS 9.3 and later

  - **Unprompted screen observation by Classroom app (supervised only)**: If set to **Allow**, teachers can silently observe the screen of students iOS devices using the Classroom app without the students' knowledge. Student devices enrolled in a class using the Classroom app automatically give permission to that course’s teacher. **Not configured** (default) prevents this feature.
- **Untrusted TLS certificates**: Choose **Block** to prevent untrusted Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows TLS certificates.
- **Enterprise app trust**: Choose **Block** to remove the **Trust Enterprise Developer** button in Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management on the device. **Not configured** (default) lets the user choose to trust apps that aren't downloaded from the app store.
- **Account modification (supervised only)**: When set to **Block**, the user can't update the device-specific settings from the iOS settings app. For example, the user can't create new device accounts, or change the user name or password. **Not configured** (default) allows users to change these settings.

  This feature also applies to settings accessible from the iOS settings app, such as Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Twitter, and more. This feature doesn't apply to apps with account settings that aren't configurable from the iOS settings app, such as the Microsoft Outlook app.
- **Screen time (supervised only)**: Choose **Block** to prevent users from setting their own restrictions in Screen Time (device settings). **Not configured** allows the user to configure device restrictions (such as parental controls or content, and privacy restrictions) on the device.

  This setting was renamed from **Enabling restrictions in the device settings**. Impact of this change:  
  
  - iOS 11.4.1 and earlier: **Block** prevents end users from setting their own restrictions in the device settings. This is the same; and there are no changes for end users.
  - iOS 12.0 and later: **Block** prevents end users from setting their own **Screen Time** in the device settings (Settings > General > Screen Time), including content and privacy restrictions. Devices upgraded to iOS 12.0 won't see the restrictions tab in the device settings anymore (Settings > General > Device Management > Management Profile > Restrictions). These settings are in **Screen Time**.

- **Modifying eSIM settings (supervised only)**: **Block** prevents users from removing or adding a cellular plan to the eSIM on the device. **Not configured** (default) allows users to change these settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 12.1 and later

- **Defer software updates (supervised only)**: When set to **Not configured** (default), software updates are shown on the device as Apple releases them. For example, if an iOS update gets released by Apple on a specific date, then that update naturally shows up on the device around the release date.

  **Enable** allows you to delay when software updates are shown on devices, from 0-90 days. This setting doesn't control when updates are or aren't installed. 

  - **Delay visibility of software updates**: Enter a value from 0-90 days. When the delay expires, users get a notification to update to the earliest version of the OS available when the delay was triggered.

    For example, if iOS 12.a is available on **January 1**, and **Delay visibility** is set to **5 days**, then iOS 12.a isn't shown as an available update on end user devices. On the **sixth day** following the release, that update is available, and end users can install it.

    This setting applies to:  
    - iOS 11.3 and later

## Password

- **Password**: **Require** the end user to enter a password to access the device. **Not configured** allows users to access the device without entering a password.
  - **Simple passwords**: Choose **Block** to require more complex passwords. **Not configured** allows simple passwords, such as `0000` and `1234`.
  - **Required password type**: Choose the type of password your organization require. Your options:
    - **Device default**
    - **Numeric**
    - **Alphanumeric**
  - **Number of non-alphanumeric characters in password**: Enter the number of symbol characters, such as `#` or `@`, that must be included in the password.
  - **Minimum password length**: Enter the minimum length a user must enter (between 4 and 14 characters).
  - **Number of sign-in failures before wiping device**: Enter the number of failed sign-ins to allow before the device is wiped (between 1-11).
  
    iOS has built-in security that can impact this setting. For example, iOS may delay triggering the policy depending on the number of sign in failures. It may also consider repeatedly entering the same passcode as one attempt. Apple's [iOS security guide](https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) (opens Apple's web site) is a good resource, and provides more specific details on passcodes.
  
  - **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required**<sup>1</sup>: Enter how long the device stays idle before the user must reenter their password. If the time you enter is longer than what's currently set on the device, then the device ignores the time you enter. Supported on iOS 8.0 and newer devices.
  - **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks**<sup>1</sup>: Enter the maximum number of minutes of inactivity allowed on the device until the screen locks. If the time you enter is longer than what's currently set on the device, then the device ignores the time you enter. When set to **immediately**, the screen locks based on the device's minimum time. On iPhone, it's 30 seconds. On iPad, it's two minutes.
  - **Password expiration (days)**: Enter the number of days before the device password must be changed.
  - **Prevent reuse of previous passwords**: Enter the number of new passwords that must be used until an old one can be reused.
  - **Fingerprint unlock**: Choose **Block** to prevent using a fingerprint to unlock the device. **Not configured** allows the user to unlock the device using a fingerprint. If you have a device running iOS 11.0 or later, blocking this setting also prevents using FaceID authentication to unlock the device. 
- **Passcode modification (supervised only)**: Choose **Block** to stop the passcode from being changed, added, or removed. Changes to passcode restrictions are ignored on supervised devices after blocking this feature. **Not configured** (default) allows passcodes to be added, changed, or removed.

  - **Fingerprint modification (supervised only)**: **Block** stops the user from changing, adding, or removing TouchID fingerprints. **Not configured** (default) allows the user update the TouchID fingerprints on the device. If you have a device running iOS 11.0 or later, blocking this setting also stops the user from changing, adding, or removing FaceID authentication. 

- **Block password AutoFill (supervised only)**: Choose **Block** to prevent using the AutoFill Passwords feature on iOS. Choosing **Block** also does the following:

  - Users aren't prompted to use a saved password in Safari or in any apps.
  - Automatic Strong Passwords are disabled, and strong passwords aren't suggested to users.

  **Not configured** (default) allows these features.

- **Block password proximity requests (supervised only)**: Choose **Block** so a user’s device doesn't request passwords from nearby devices. **Not configured** (default) allows these password requests.
- **Block password sharing (supervised only)**: **Block** prevents sharing passwords between devices using AirDrop. **Not configured** (default) allows passwords to be shared.
- **Require Touch ID or Face ID authentication for password or credit card information AutoFill (supervised only)**: When set to **Require**, users must authenticate using TouchID or FaceID before passwords or credit card information can be auto filled in Safari and other apps. **Not configured** (default) allows users to control this feature in the device settings.

  This feature applies to:  
  - iOS 11.0 and later
  
<sup>1</sup>When you configure the **Maximum minutes of inactivity until screen locks** and **Maximum minutes after screen lock before password is required** settings, they're applied in sequence. For example, if you set the value for both settings to **5** minutes, the screen turns off automatically after five minutes, and the device is locked after an additional five minutes. However, if the user turns off the screen manually, the second setting is immediately applied. In the same example, after the user turns off the screen, the device locks five minutes later.

It can only run that app. For example, add an app that lets users take a test on the device. When the apps actions are complete, or you remove this policy, the device returns to its normal state.

To add apps, you can:

- Enter the **App name** and **App Bundle ID**, and select **Add**. [Bundle IDs for built-in iOS apps](bundle-ids-built-in-ios-apps.md) includes some apps with their IDs.
- **Import** a CSV file with the list of app names and their bundle IDs. Or, **Export** an existing list that includes the apps.

## Kiosk (supervised only)

- **App to run in kiosk mode**: Choose the type of apps you want to run in kiosk mode. Your options:
  - **Not configured**: Kiosk settings aren't applied. The device doesn't run in kiosk-mode.
  - **Store App**: Enter the URL to an app in the iTunes App store.
  - **Managed App**: Choose an app you added to Intune.
  - **Built-In App**: Enter the [bundle ID](bundle-ids-built-in-ios-apps.md) of the built-in app.

- **Assistive touch**: **Require** the Assistive Touch accessibility setting be on the device. This feature helps users with on-screen gestures that might be difficult for them. **Not configured** doesn't run or enable this feature in kiosk mode.
- **Invert colors**: **Require** the Invert Colors accessibility setting so users with visual impairments can change the display screen. **Not configured** doesn't run or enable this feature in kiosk mode.
- **Mono audio**: **Require** the Mono audio accessibility setting be on the device. **Not configured** doesn't run or enable this feature in kiosk mode.
- **VoiceOver**: **Require** the VoiceOver accessibility setting be on the device to read text on the screen out loud. **Not configured** doesn't run or enable this feature in kiosk mode.
- **Zoom**: **Require** the Zoom setting be on the device to let users use touch to zoom in on the screen. **Not configured** doesn't run or enable this feature in kiosk mode.
- **Auto lock**: **Allow** automatic locking of the device. **Not configured** disables this feature.
- **Ringer switch**: **Allow** the ringer (mute) switch on the device. **Not configured** disables this feature.
- **Screen rotation**: **Allow** changing the screen orientation when the user rotates the device. **Not configured** disables this feature.
- **Screen sleep button**: Choose **Allow** to disable the screen sleep wake button on the device. **Not configured** enables this feature.
- **Touch**: **Block** disables the touchscreen on the device. **Not configured** allows the user to use the touchscreen.
- **Volume buttons**: **Allow** using the volume buttons on the device. **Not configured** disables the volume buttons.
- **Assistive touch control**: **Allow** let users use the assistive touch function. **Not configured** disables this feature.
- **Invert colors control**: **Allow** invert color changes to let users adjust the invert colors function. **Not configured** disables this feature.
- **Speak on selected text**: **Allow** the Speak Selection accessibility settings be on the device. This feature reads text that the user selects out loud. **Not configured** disables this feature.
- **VoiceOver control**: **Allow** voiceover changes to let users update the VoiceOver function, such as how fast on-screen text is read out loud. **Not configured** prevents voiceover changes.
- **Zoom control**: **Allow** zoom changes by the user. **Not configured** prevents zoom changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can configure an iOS device for kiosk mode, you must use the Apple Configurator tool or the Apple Device Enrollment Program to put the device into supervised mode. See Apple's guide on using the Apple Configurator tool.
> If the iOS app you enter is installed after you assign the profile, then the device doesn't enter kiosk mode until the device is restarted.

## Domains

- **Unmarked email domains** > **Email Domain URL**: Add one or more URLs to the list. When end users receive an email from a domain other than the domains you enter, the email is marked as untrusted in the iOS Mail app.

- **Managed web domains** > **Web Domain URL**; Add one or more URLs to the list. When documents are downloaded from the domains you enter, they're considered managed. This setting applies only to documents downloaded using the Safari browser.

- **Safari password autofill domains** > **Domain URL**: Add one or more URLs to the list. Users can only save web passwords from URLs in this list. This setting applies only to the Safari browser, and to iOS 9.3 and later devices in supervised mode. If you don't specify any URLs, then passwords can be saved from all web sites.

## Settings that require supervised mode

iOS supervised mode can only be enabled during initial device setup through Apple’s Device Enrollment Program, or by using Apple Configurator. Once supervised mode is enabled, Intune can configure a device with the following functionality:

- App Lock (Single App Mode)

> [!NOTE]
> Apple confirmed that certain settings move to supervised-only in 2019. We recommend taking this into consideration when using these settings, instead of waiting for Apple to migrate them to supervised-only:
> - App installation by end users
> - App removal
> - FaceTime
> - Safari
> - iTunes
> - Explicit content
> - iCloud documents and data
> - Multiplayer gaming
> - Add Game Center friends
> - Siri
